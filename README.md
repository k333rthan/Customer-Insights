## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to analyze the pricing, distribution, and trends of drugs across various stores using the provided dataset. By leveraging SQL, we aim to gain actionable insights into drug pricing patterns, store performance, and product availability, which can aid decision-making in the pharmaceutical industry.

## Customer Status Distribution
SALE customers dominate the interaction, reflecting a strong conversion pipeline.
Notable statuses include:
RETURN and REVISITED TO BUY ‚Äì potential for post-sale engagement improvements.
NEW and EXCHANGE ‚Äì active footfall from new and returning customers.

## Return Reasons Analysis

"Just Browsing" accounts for 50% of returns ‚Äì signals need for stronger product engagement.

"Not in Budget" and "Particular Requirement" each represent 11.76% ‚Äì opportunity to refine pricing strategy and inventory alignment.

Other reasons: Low Stock, Unavailable Items, Didn‚Äôt Like ‚Äì highlight inventory and merchandising improvements needed.

## Customer Count by Price Range

Maximum customer count falls in ‚Çπ2001‚Äì‚Çπ5000 range.
